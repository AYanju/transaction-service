# Transaction Service

## 📌 Overview

The Transaction Service handles the recording, retrieval, and presentation of all financial transactions across the platform. It provides customers with transparent access to their transaction history, generates digital receipts for individual transactions, and produces account statements for regulatory and personal use.

It acts as a query and reporting layer over the Account Service ledger, ensuring customers and admins have accurate visibility into all money movements.
